# HealthToday
This is a iOS app that was built using the Swift language, as well as a few different packages that were imported using cocoapods
The app uses CoreLocation to find the user's location, openWeatherMap API for the weather data, covidActNow API for the Covid Data, and the fcc.gov API for the FIPs code
The App logo was made by the creator of this project using Canva
The symbols inside the app are either from free-to-use sources, or from the Apple Symbols collection
